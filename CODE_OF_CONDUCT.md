# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of our club's philosophy, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harmonious and uplifting experience for everyone, irrespective of age, background, beliefs, or identity. Our commitment extends beyond human welfare to include the well-being of all forms of existence, the environment, and non-living entities.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

We embrace the interconnectedness of all forms of existence, recognizing the intrinsic value in each entity. Our behavior as contributors should reflect this understanding:

- **Holistic Approach:** We focus on the upliftment and well-being of every form of existence, fostering a holistic perspective that goes beyond human-centric views.
- **Sustainability and Regeneration:** We are committed to sustaining the vitality of individual forms of existence and actively contributing to the regeneration of ecosystems, communities, and the broader environment.

- **Celebrating Diversity:** We celebrate the diversity inherent in all forms of existence, creating an inclusive environment where every entity is valued and empowered.

- **Technological Harmony:** As advocates for technological advancement, we prioritize solutions that benefit all forms of existence, avoiding progress that leads to the degradation of our planet and its inhabitants.

- **Ethical Responsibility:** We acknowledge the inherent rights of all forms of existence and commit to ethical practices that safeguard the well-being of every entity.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers are responsible for upholding these standards and fostering an environment that aligns with our club's philosophy. We encourage positive behavior and take corrective action in response to any instances of behavior that deviates from our principles.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. We extend our commitment to creating a positive environment to all forms of existence and the interconnected web that binds them.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [existence.bloomify@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
