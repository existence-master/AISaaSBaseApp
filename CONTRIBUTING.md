   Create a new branch for your contribution:

   ```shell

10. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**

    Go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request. This informs the project maintainers that you have changes you'd like them to review and merge into the main codebase. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the pull request.

11. **Follow Up**

    Engage in discussions with maintainers and address any feedback. Be responsive to comments on your pull request. The result can be a merger of your pull request. Congrats! Or in other case, don't despair, you can try for other issues.
